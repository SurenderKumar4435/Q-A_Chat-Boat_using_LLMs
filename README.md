# Project Overview

The project is an AI-powered question and answer chat bot that connect Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide accurate, and best  responses base on the user input. Users can easily interact with this system by a web interface Streamlit, type their questions or context/input, and receive accurate answers that is generated by LLM model. The system is capable of understanding diverse topics, making it a versatile assistant for learning, research, or customer support scenarios.

Key Features:=

1. AI-Powered Question Answering:=
   Uses Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo
   it Provides accurate and context-aware answers base on user input.

2. Clean and Readable Output:=
   Use StrOutputParser to ensure the AI response is plain text.


3. User-Friendly Frontend:=
   It Supports interactive web interface:
   Streamlit version: Real-time input box with instant display of LLM AI responses.


4. Secure API Key Management:=
   Uses environment variables (.env) to safely store our OpenAPI keys.

5. Prompt Engineering:=
   This model allow Structured prompts to act as a helpful assistant.
   Dynamic placeholders ({topic}) ensure flexible question handling.

6. Extensible LLM Pipeline(Chain using Pipe Operator (|) ):=
   Combines Prompt → LLM → Output Parser using LangChain chains.
